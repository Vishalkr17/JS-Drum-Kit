# JavaScript Drum Kit
JavaScript Drum Kit project from Javascript30.com by Wes Bos.
The JavaScript Drum Kit is a web application that allows users to play drum sounds using their computer keyboard. Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a different drum sound, and when a user presses a key, the corresponding sound is played along with a visual effect on the screen.

# Usage
When you open the application in your web browser, you will see a collection of div elements, each containing a letter that corresponds with a key on your keyboard and the name of the soundclip that will be played when that button is clicked.
To play a drum sound, simply press the key on your keyboard that corresponds with the letter displayed in one of the div elements. The corresponding soundclip will be played and a temporary highlight or border will be displayed around the div element to indicate that it has been triggered.
